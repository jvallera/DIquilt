## Digital Inclusion Quilt

A community quilt that celebrates the theme “Equal access for all”.

#### About 

The Digital Inclusion Quilt is a hands-on activity celebrating the theme “Equal access for all”. Visitors will use paper, fabric, electronics and other materials to create 8.5 inch x 8.5 inch quilt panels that will be combined into one collective quilt. Templates and instructions will be provided so visitors are mostly self-guided, but can request assistance from the facilitator. 

Quilts are an example of collective impact: a group of people working together to create a large piece of artwork with a community message. The theme “equal access for all” gives people of all ages a chance to express their vision for building a healthy, digitally inclusive future. Visitors may add simple circuits to their quilt pieces, creating an opportunity for them to explore basic electronics. The project encourages reflection and expression, providing a unique way to showcase Burlington’s diverse community voices.
